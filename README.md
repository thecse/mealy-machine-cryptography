# Mealy-Machine-Cryptography
Encrypting and Decrypting messages using Mealy Machine, every character of the message will pass on to the mealy machine structure after which, it will give an output which will encrypt the message, and to decrypt the message we need to inverse the whole process of encryption which cannot be done if we don't have correct structure, so the user will not be able to decrypt the real message until he/she doesn't have the correct mealy machine structure.

P.S. - The Algorithms, which I used is not the same as in the paper above.
